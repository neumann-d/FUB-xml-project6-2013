Being a smart tv was great too as I don't need a Roku or another box like that to watch Netflix. I plugged everything in and it just worked after a short set-up proceed. Got it home and in 15 minutes I was enjoying the beauty of this tv." .

The picture is absolutely everything i wanted. It is 120Hz freshing rate, its a very smooth picture for the size. I mostly use it for gaming and sports, and let me say it is awesome when it comes to Xbox 360. There is no blur or ghost with this tv and it delivers the picture and preciseness i am looking for." .

  <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/microdata#http://schema.org/Review%23:description> "A year or two ago, I set out to buy myself a television that was perfect for gaming. I bought and returned many TV's. (multiple low end samsung lcds, Insignia [god awful]), and eventually, the only television that met my standards of quality (for $500 or less) was the Panasonic Viera 42\" Plasma. I am now happy say that there is a lightweight, led flat panel 1920x1080 display that can stand toe to toe with the panasonic plasma, and all at an affordable price. The Vizio M321i-A2 can do it all- gaming, computer monitor, TV, built in wifi for streaming Netflix, yadayada. Smaller screen, but higher quality that you see in $800+ displays.\nLike I was saying, there is a negligible amount of input lag- Input lag is a make or break the deal kind of thing for me, but all you have to do is: MENU//picture settings//more//advanced picture//--- disable: film mode, Black detail, reduce signal noise, and reduce block noise.\nDo that, and you'll all but eliminate post processing, thereby reducing input lag.\nIf you've been waiting for a 32\" highend-quailty tv, try this out. If you manage to find an aspect of it that you don't care for, return it at no cost to you. I'll bet that if you're a picky person like myself, you'll have a 90% chance of keeping it.\nAlso, the the backlit remote is sexy, so far as remotes go." .

  <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/microdata#http://schema.org/Review%23:description> "Bought the TV today. Great aesthetics right off the bat; thin bezel, conveniently placed inputs, 3 HDMI ports - what's not to like?. Hooked up my PC, cable, PS3 and XBOX to it. The cool thing about this TV is that it has a quite a few picture presets, that really does work. Set my PC to the computer mode preset and the picture is really soothing, no eye strain at all. PS3 and xbox are using Game mode, same results, everything you would expect; even better I should say. Lastly, I have a Samsung Smart 3dtv at home and the TV ghosts like crazy when the backlight is turned up. With this TV, I haven't seen a bit of ghosting even with the backlight maxed out; I am very nitpicking. Overall, I am really satisfied with the purchase. Vizio TV's are underrated but if they are coming up with devices like this, they would top the charts in no time." .
